Planned features / unsolved issues / wishlist items

* Allow an OpenVPN tunnel to provide only partial routing, instead of always
  providing the default route.
  + Request DHCP rfc3442-classless-static-routes and convert to matching
    push requests.
  + Per-realm flag whether or not to push the default route.
  + Pass full_username on to DHCP server as client-identifer, allowing the
    DHCP server to send static routes depending on the full_username.

* Refresh DHCP leases.
  + Remember granted leases, refresh in time.
  + Track client connection list and disconnect events.  Prevents refreshing
    leases from clients that are no longer connected.
  + Boot-strap the list of granted leases by reading all client connection
    lists and assuming that the next lease refresh is due soon.  (Alternatively,
    odrd would need to maintain a database.)

* Try to implement some mechanism to determine if an IP address is already in
  use (especially by non-OpenVPN users).
  + Use ARP resolve / ARP ping to determine whether an IP address is in use.
  + Communicate with other odr instances to determine whether the
    full_username is known as an active client to someone.
  + If IP active, but full_username unknown to odr instances -> non-OpenVPN
    user using the address -> request a different address.
    Otherwise the same full_username is active on several instances -> kill
    it on the older instance.

* Release DHCP leases on coordinated disconnect.
  + Probably not possible, because there's no such thing as a coordinated
    disconnect in OpenVPN.
