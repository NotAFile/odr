import weakref


class WeakBoundMethod(object):
    """Used to create a proxy method of a bound method, which weakly references
    the method's binding instance.


    Assuming the following simple class:

        >>> class Example(object):
        ...     def print_num(self, a_number):
        ...         print(a_number)

    We can create an example instance and create a weak reference to the bound
    print_num method:

        >>> e = Example()
        >>> wmeth = WeakBoundMethod(e.print_num)

    The proxy method works as expected:

        >>> wmeth(5)
        5

    It holds no strong reference to e, so deleting e will invalidate the proxy
    method:

        >>> del e
        >>> wmeth(5)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        ReferenceError

    The exception can be suppressed by setting ignore_emptiness to True:

        >>> e = Example()
        >>> wmeth = WeakBoundMethod(e.print_num, ignore_emptiness=True)
        >>> wmeth(5)
        5
        >>> del e
        >>> wmeth(5)
